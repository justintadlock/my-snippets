# My Snippets

The My Snippets plugin allows you to define custom widget content on a per-post basis from the edit post screen.

While the plugin is both simple and powerful, it'll never replace such plugins as Widget Logic and Widget Context nor is that the plan. What it does is allow you to add custom widget content from the edit post screen without having to go to your Widgets screen in the admin for additional configuration.

## Features:

* Post-by-post (or any public post type) widget content that you control.
* Extra widget for use on your site.
* Easy-to-use snippets settings box on the post editor.
* Supports HTML and shortcodes.

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0

* Recoded the plugin to utilize modern PHP techniques.
* Upgraded the widget to make sure it plays nicely with PHP 7+.

### Version 0.2.0

* Rewrote the code base to bring everything up to current WordPress standards.
* Added support for custom post types.

### Version 0.1.0

* Plugin launch.  Everything's new!
