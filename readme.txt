Allows you to add custom widget content on a post-by-post basis from the edit post screen.

== Description ==

The My Snippets plugin allows you to define custom widget content on a per-post basis from the edit post screen.

While the plugin is both simple and powerful, it'll never replace such plugins as Widget Logic and Widget Context nor is that the plan. What it does is allow you to add custom widget content from the edit post screen without having to go to your Widgets screen in the admin for additional configuration.

### Features:

* Post-by-post (or any public post type) widget content that you control.
* Extra widget for use on your site.
* Easy-to-use snippets settings box on the post editor.
* Supports HTML and shortcodes.

### Professional Support

If you need professional plugin support from me, the plugin author, you can access the support forums at [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com), which is a professional WordPress help/support site where I handle support for all my plugins and themes for a community of 70,000+ users (and growing).

### Donations

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why was this plugin created?

I love plugins like [Widget Context](http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-contex) and [Widget Logic](http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-logic), which allow you to add contextual widgets.  But, the thing that those plugins don't do is give you a way to add widget content without visiting the Widgets admin screen in WordPress.

I wanted a way to add a widget on a per-post basis when writing the post itself, so this plugin was born.

No, it's not a replacement of the aforementioned plugins but, rather, a complementary plugin.

### How do I use it?

First, you need to add the "My Snippets" widget to any sidebar on your site.  It won't appear on the front end just yet though.

Any time you write a post, you can add a custom snippet title and content in the "My Snippets" meta box.  If you write something in the meta box, it will automatically be shown in place of the widget when viewing that post on your site.  If nothing is written in the meta box, nothing will be shown for the post.

### Does it work for other post types?

Yes, it works for all publicly-queryable post types.  Basically, if your post type has its own "page" on the front end of the site, you can add custom snippet content.

### What else do I need to know?

That's pretty much it.  This is an extremely simple plugin.
